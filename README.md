## Description

> Our data models can be crazy. Sometimes you take a quick look and you already see that `if-else` to handle it properly. But if you use TypeScript you can handle most of it on the compilation level. I will show you how Iâ€™m dealing with strange types cases, how to avoid type-mess in your app, properly use algebraic types and how to benefit from structural type system.
